Budai (also known as Hotei or Pu-Tai)[a][1][2] is a semi-historical Chinese monk who is venerated as a deity in Chinese Buddhism and was also introduced into the Japanese Buddhist pantheon.[3] He allegedly lived around the 10th century in the Wuyue kingdom. His name literally means "cloth sack",[3] and refers to the bag that he is conventionally depicted as carrying as he wanders aimlessly. His jolly nature, humorous personality, and eccentric lifestyle distinguish him from most Buddhist masters or figures. He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the "Laughing Buddha".[b][2] As he is traditionally depicted as fat, he is also referred to as the "Fat Buddha".[4]
